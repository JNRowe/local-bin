~/bin repository
================

This is the repository of the scripts that can be found in ``~/bin`` on
systems I use, just the little hacks that make my life easier.

If you find any problems with this repository either drop me an email_
or file an issue_.  Locally bugs are managed with ditz_, so if you're
working with a clone of the repository you can report, list and fix bugs
directly from the source tree.
