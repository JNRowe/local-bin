~/bin repository
================

This is the repository of the scripts that can be found in ``~/bin`` on
systems I use, just the little hacks that make my life easier.

If you find any problems with this repository either drop me an email_
or file an issue_.  Locally bugs are managed with `Bugs Everywhere`_, so
if you're working with a clone of the repository you can report, list
and fix bugs directly from the source tree [#]_ .

.. [#] There is a Git mirror of `Bugs Everywhere`_ available at
       http://github.com/JNRowe/Bugs-Everywhere .
