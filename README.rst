~/bin repository
================

This is a subset of the repository that can be found in ``~/bin`` on systems I
use, just the little hacks that make my life easier.  Over time it should become
the full content of that directory, but there is no target date to achieve that.

If you find any problems with this repository either drop me an email_ or file
an issue_.
